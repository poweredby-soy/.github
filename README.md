Hi! I'm Ruben — powered by soy.
We design and develop web applications for animal rights organizations, combining technical expertise with a commitment to animal liberation.
Our focus is simple: help mission-driven teams get more done online, with tools that are fast, privacy-friendly, and easy to use.

## Free hosted services for animal rights organizations
We provide hosted tools at no cost to qualifying organizations. No strings attached — just plant-powered solutions.
- Plausible
    - A lightweight, privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics that helps you understand website traffic without compromising user data.

- GlitchTip (coming soon)
    - Open source error tracking to monitor, triage, and fix issues with clear reports and notifications.

- n8n (coming soon)
    - Workflow automation to connect services and streamline repetitive tasks with a visual editor.

If your organization could benefit from any of the above, we’d love to help you get started.

## What we value
- Purpose-driven technology for animal liberation
- Privacy-first tooling and respectful analytics
- Open source–friendly choices wherever possible
